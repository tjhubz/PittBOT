# PittBOT

**This is the bot that will be used for all official Pitt ResLife Discord guilds.**

https://www.maskup.pitt.edu/residence-life/


## What it does

- Automatic role assignment
  - Each RA will have their own invite link to give to their residents. When that invite is used it will give them the role that gives them access to their floor's chat.
- Student verification
  - Students must enter their pitt email upon joining the server. It keeps emails in a database for lookup.
- Synchronized event creation
  - Since ResLife hosts multiple events throughout the year they can be easily posted to all 11 Discord servers

## Future features

- Slur prevention
  - Self-explanatory
- Automatic assistance with common questions (FAQ system)
  - For instance, if someone asks "What are meal swaps?" it would inform them what they are and how to use them.
